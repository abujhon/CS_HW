### Exploitation
_TODO: Fill out the details below. Include screenshots where possible.
The Red Team was able to penetrate `Target 1` and retrieve the following confidential data:

1. Scan the network to identify the IP addresses of Target 1.
    $nmap -sV 192.168.1.110
2. Document all exposed ports and services.

3. Enumerate the WordPress site. One flag is discoverable after this step.
    **Hint**: Look for the `Users` section in the output.

4. SSH to target system with acquired user credentials
    ssh to target machine.png
5. Find the MySQL database password.
    find wpconfig.png
    get credentials.png
6. Use the credentials to log into MySQL and dump WordPress user password hashes
    access to mysql.png
7. query the database to find useful information 
    mysql> select * from wp_posts;
    refer to: flags.jpeg
    mysql> select * from wp_users;
    refer to: users.jpeg
8. crack the password
